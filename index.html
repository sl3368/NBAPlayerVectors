<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Competition in the National Basketball Association (NBA) has intensified over the years and teams are exploring all options to gain an edge. As a result, the strategy of the sport (how to construct a team, which plays to run, what shots to take, etc.) has also evolved drastically. The use of technology to track players’ movements and actions on the court has generated rich data sets to leverage.</p>

<p>A team is not just the sum of its parts, there are many intricacies to the on court dynamics that can dictate a team’s success. Usually, a player’s individual statistics have been used to analyze their ability and predict performance with potential teammates. Yet this information may be limited in capturing features which may indicate how well players fit with each other. In this project I modified matrix factorization to model line up data, which only records how a cumulative group of players performed over the course of a season.</p>

<h3>
<a id="data" class="anchor" href="#data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data</h3>

<p>The data set provided at <code>basketball-reference.com</code>, has line-ups of size 2 (dyadic), 3, 4, and 5 players for all teams in the NBA over the past 10+ years. For each data point, there exists a unique set of players,{a, b, c, d, e}, and a set of metrics which describe their performance when playing together: points, minutes played, shooting, etc. In order to collect all this data from the website, a crawler was written in JavaScript which can be run using Node.js. Line ups of all sizes have been collected for the previous NBA season (2014-2015). The advantage of the crawler is that it can easily scrape data for even earlier seasons, theoretically reducing variance in inference estimates. But the league is constantly changing. Players develop, experience injuries, trades are made, and coaches are replaced. There could be several hidden factors which are not accounted for that affect the data season to season. Therefore only a single season was used for this analysis.</p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
