{"name":"Inferring NBA Player Vectors","tagline":"Probabilistic Matrix Factorization for Basketball Players","body":"###Introduction\r\nCompetition in the National Basketball Association (NBA) has intensified over the years, teams are exploring all options to gain an edge. As a result, the strategy of the sport (how to construct a team, which plays to run, what shots to take, etc.) has also evolved drastically. The use of technology to track players’ movements and actions on the court has generated rich data sets to leverage. With the deluge of data, many teams are using players’ statistics to facilitate decision making and analysis.\r\nA team is not just the sum of its parts. There are many intricacies to the on court dynamics that can dictate a team’s success. Usually, a player’s individual statistics have been used to analyze their ability and predict performance with potential teammates. Yet this information may be limited in capturing features which may indicate how well players fit with each other. Instead, I have modified matrix factorization to model line up data, which only records how a cumulative group of players performed over the course of a season. This highly accurate model can better infer how well players perform together, resulting in a novel method to develop strategy in the sport.\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
